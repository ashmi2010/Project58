        <p>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go home from my school,I like to read such books after finishing my homework. I am eleven years old and i read in class six.Now, I know reading is a very good habit which can make me complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone,however I got it naturally.Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of knowledge,enjoyment,inspiration,and instruction. It makes us disciplined,loyal,punctual and most importantly a successful person in life.</p>
